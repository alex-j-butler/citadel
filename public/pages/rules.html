<h1 id="SS-1">1. Season Structure</h1>
	<h2 id="SS-2">1.1. Regular Season</h2>
	<div>
		<p>
			The regular season will consist of 7 weeks where teams will face off on a different map each week.
		</p>
		<p>
			Teams will have from Monday - Friday to compete for their official matches. Refer to section 2.1.1 for Match Times and deadline requirements.
		</p>
	</div>

	<h2 id="SS-3">1.2. Play-offs</h2>
	<div>
		<p>
			The top 8 ranked teams from each division at the end of the Regular Season will qualify for Playoffs. A modified Double Sided bracket will be played over the span of 4 weeks, with each game being a Best of 3 match.
		</p>
		<p>
			Teams that qualify for Playoffs but are not interested in participating in or may not be able to field a lineup for this stage of the season can alert admins to pass their spot on to the next team in the rankings. In this situation all teams rankings below the team that pulls out of Playoffs will be shifted up by 1. Pulling out of playoffs will not induce any penalties.
		</p>
		<p>
			The bracket will start with the High and Low side of the brackets facing off, with 1v4 and 2v3 in High, and 5v8 and 6v7 in Low. Losers from the Low side will be eliminated and winners from the High side will skip the next round.
		</p>
		<p>
			Finals Round 2 will consist of two games to decide who proceeds, with losers being eliminated. These matches will be 3v6 and 4v5. The losers are eliminated and the winners proceed to the Finals Round 3.
		</p>
		<p>
			Finals Round 3 decides who will play in the Grand Final. The games will be 1v3 and 2v4. The winners play in the Grand Final and the losers place for Third Place.
		</p>
		<p>
			(The numbers used to describe games [e.g. 2v3] are meant to simulate the seeds of the teams playing against each other. The listed games may not always happen, but are listed so to provide a clear description of the Playoffs structure.)
		</p>
	</div>

	<h2 id="SS-4">1.3. Off Season</h2>
	<div>
		<p>
			The Offseason will last for 6-7 weeks, during which no season games will be played, and necessary changes to the league can be made.
		</p>
	</div>

	<h2 id="SS-5">1.4. International Teams and/or Players</h2>
	<div>
		<p>
			Teams from different regions will not be restricted in playing. If they have competitive experience in other leagues from their region, that will be taken into account regardless of their ping.
		</p>
		<p>
			Teams will not be forced to play on servers from other regions to allow for international teams/players to gain balanced ping. Standard server locations that are recommended are Brisbane, Canberra, Melbourne, Sydney and Perth.
		</p>
		<p>
			If teams do want to pursue getting a server location that gives balanced ping for asia players as an example, we would recommend renting a Perth server.
		</p>
	</div>

<h1 id="MS-1">2. Match Structure</h1>
	<h2 id="MS-2">2.1. Match Times</h2>
		<div>
			<b>Score reporting:</b> Friday - 11:59PM NSW<br />
			<b>Schedule release:</b> Friday night - Saturday morning<br />
			<b>Complete negotiations:</b> Sunday - 11:59PM NSW
			<p>
				(In this document NSW refers to the timezone that NSW operates in at the time of league play, whether it be AEDT or AEST)
			</p>
		</div>

	<h2 id="MS-3">2.2. Match Negotiations</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				All match negotiations need to be completed by Sunday - 11:59PM NSW. If teams are unable to decide by this time, you will need to contact the staff team and begin the mediation process, outlined in section 2.2.1.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is expected that all teams have 3 days that they are able to play their matches. This will allow in most cases overlaps so that matches can easily be decided on.
			</p>
		</div>

		<h3 id="MS-31">2.2.1 Mediation</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					Notifying the staff team about possible issues with organising the match needs to be done ASAP. In an event where neither team is able to find matching days, the staff team will determine the optimal time where both teams can field the most amount of players.
				</p>
				<p>
					Both teams are required to give at least 3 days through the match period that their team is able to play. Bias will be given to the team that is able to meet the 3 day requirement.
				</p>
			</div>

	<h2 id="MS-4">2.3. Team Responsibilities</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				Team responsibilities usually fall upon the designated captains on the team. If no captains are able to fulfill the tasks for the team, designate someone to work with a staff member so that your team isn’t punished.
			</p>
		</div>

		<h3 id="MS-41">2.3.1. Home</h3>
			<ul>

	<h2 id="MS-5">2.4. Game Types</h2>
		<h3 id="MS-51">2.4.1. CP</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					Examples of CP maps are cp_gullywash and cp_vanguard.
				</p>
				<p>
					CP maps will be played in one 30 minute half where the team with the highest score at the end of 30 minutes, or the first team to 5, will win. In the situation of tied scores at the end of 30 minutes a Golden Cap must be played, where the two teams play one round separate of the 30 minute half, the winner of that single round wins the game. A Golden Cap must be played in a tie situation.
				</p>
			</div>

		<h3 id="MS-52">2.4.2. Koth</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					Examples of Koth maps include koth_ashville_rc1 and koth_product_rc8.
				</p>
				<p>
					Koth maps will be played in one half with no time limit. The first team to win 3 rounds wins the game. There can be no ties on Koth maps.
				</p>
			</div>

		<h3 id="MS-53">2.4.3. Payload & Attack/Defend</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					Examples of Payload & Attack/Defend maps are pl_upward and cp_steel. 
				</p>
				<p>
					These maps will be played in a minimum of 2, and a maximum of 3, halves. One half for these maps is when both teams have had 1 turn to attack and 1 turn to defend. The first team to win 2 halves wins the game. There can be no ties on Payload & Attack/Defend maps.
				</p>
			</div>

	<h2 id="MS-6">2.5. Class Restrictions</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				Highlander runs on a maximum of one person per class. Spy is set to unlimited to allow for players to swap around classes without switching to spec.

				<li>1 - Engineer</li>
				<li>1 - Medic</li>
				<li>1 - Sniper</li>
				<li>1 - Spy (class limit in config set to unlimited)</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

	<h2 id="MS-7">2.6. Whitelist</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				Qixalite whitelist can be located <a href="http://whitelist.tf/8312">here</a> at whitelist.tf. Furthermore, weapon pickups are allowed.
			</p>
		</div>

	<h2 id="MS-8">2.7. Server Config</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				Qixalite server configs can be located <a href="https://github.com/Qixalite/tf2-configs">here</a> at github.com for download and usage.
			</p>
		</div>

	<h2 id="MS-9">2.8. Pausing</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				Both teams are permitted a maximum of 2 pauses in each match. These pauses can be taken once per half on payload maps and once per round on KOTH and CP maps. Each pause is limited to 5 minutes.
			</p>
			<p>
				If the opposing team permits a longer pause period that is acceptable and won’t be punished. Purposeful longer pauses or failing to un-pause and continue the match can result in the offending team being punished.
			</p>
		</div>

	<h2 id="MS-10">2.9. Recording</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				All players are expected to record POVs of their matches. Upon request by the staff team, the POV needs to be submitted within 24 - 48 hours.
			</p>
			<p>
				Please be aware that staff will perform random POV checks to ensure players are abiding by the rule. Reports of a player cheating or other disputes may also get your POV requested.
			</p>
		</div>

	<h2 id="MS-11">2.10. Spectators</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				Staff are the only people allowed to be present during an official match on spectator. Switching classes during the match, please avoid going to spectator and utilise the spy class limit.
			</p>
		</div>

	<h2 id="MS-12">2.11. Map Selection</h2>
		<h3 id="MS-121">2.11.1. Regular Season</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					During the 7 week period of regular season, the map selection process will be predetermined by the staff team. In most cases maps that haven’t been played for sometime will go through testing; this also includes new maps that haven’t been played at all.
				</p>
				<p>
					The testing will primarily include invite only PUGs and/or preseason matches between teams in the top division.
				</p>
			</div>

		<h3 id="MS-122">2.11.2. Play-offs</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					In playoffs the maps being played in each game will be decided through a pick/ban process. The picks and bans will operate as follows:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Higher Seeded Team Bans</li>
					<li>Lower Seeded Team Bans</li>
					<li>Higher Seeded Team Picks</li>
					<li>Lower Seeded Team Picks</li>
					<li>Lower Seeded Team Bans</li>
					<li>Higher Seeded Team Picks</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					The teams will pick and ban from the regular season map pool.
				</p>
			</div>

	<h2 id="MS-13">2.12. Mercs</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				A player not rostered, but used instead of an unavailable team member is considered a mercenary. Eligible mercenaries require a Qixalite league account and no active punishments or associated punishments.
			</p>
			<p>
				A maximum of two mercenaries are allowed, but merc usage is limited to four matches per season and a team is restricted to use the same player no more than two matches in a season.
			</p>
			<p>
				Message the SteamID and Qixalite league account to one of the staff team; this will begin the process to authorise the player for the match. Submitting mercenary requests with players that are in a higher skill bracket, could get your request denied.
			</p>
			<p>
				Approved Requests will require you to post the steamID and Qixalite league account in the match thread. Failing to follow this process could lead to a mercenary ban for your team.
			</p>
		</div>

	<h2 id="MS-14">2.13. Disputes</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				For any reason that a team breaks the rules during a match that could lead to but is not limited to a toxic environment or utilising exploits to gain an advantage needs to be reported to the staff team.
			</p>
			<p>
				Gather evidence such as STV or screenshots and submit it to the staff team. It will be reviewed and the necessary punishments will be delivered to the offending team.
			</p>
		</div>

	<h2 id="MS-15">2.14. Scoring</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				Each round will require 1 map to be played. The winner of this map will be rewarded 4 points on the leaderboard with the losing team gaining no points. Total score will also be tracked based on the amount of points a team scores in a match. Matches where 1 team forfeits will result in the winning team gaining 4 points, with technical forfeits granting each team 2 point. Mutual forfeits will not reward either team.
			</p>
		</div>

		<h3 id="MS-151">2.14.1. Tie-Breaker</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					Teams with the same amount of Points will be seperated on 3 factors. The first will be Tied-Wins. A team’s Tied-Wins score is dependant on the amount of games they have won against teams with the same amount of Points.
				</p>
				<p>
					The second factor is Total Score. This value is based on the amount of rounds scored in each each match played by a team. For example a game with the score 2-1 would give 2 Total Score to the winning team and 1 Total Score to the losing team.
				</p>
				<p>
					The final factor is Total wins, which is the amount of map wins a team has. These Tie-Breakers will be prioritised in the order given when deciding a tied situation on the leaderboard. Forfeit wins do not count towards this.
				</p>
			</div>

		<h3 id="MS-151">2.14.2. Submitting Scores</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					After a match is complete one of the team leaders (generally the winning team’s) must submit the scores on their match page. These scores must be confirmed by the enemy team’s leader. Scores must be submitted and confirmed by Friday at 11:59PM NSW for that week.
				</p>
			</div>

	<h2 id="MS-16">2.15. Forfeits</h2>
		<h3 id="MS-161">2.15.1. Win / Loss</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					Rule breaches during an official game and no contact or attempts to organise the match will result in a forfeit win to the victim team. Furthermore, both teams will have a maximum of 15 minutes past the agreed upon time to be readied.
				</p>
				<p>
					Server organisation is at the fault of both teams, but is expected that the home team setup and send the server details to the away team. However, if this has not happened, the away team must book a server and try to provide server details. Similarly, the home team will have 15 minutes past to join the server or provide server details.
				</p>
				<p>
					Forfeit wins require chat logs or evidence suggesting an intent to organise the match, but with no communication back from the other team. Post all evidence into the match thread when submitting the result.
				</p>
				<p>
					A forfeit loss will count towards a forfeit punishment.
				</p>
				<b>Point Amount:</b> 4
			</div>

		<h3 id="MS-162">2.15.2. Mutual</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					Instances where both teams have not organised or come to an agreement on the match times by Monday 11:59 PM - NSW will result in a mutual forfeit. Addition to this, if no scores have been submitted by either team, the match will also result in a mutual forfeit.
				</p>
				<p>
					The exception to the rule is if both teams have contacted staff in regards to match organisational difficulties, then match negotiations will be extended at the discretion of the the staff team. However, if mediation is required a staff member will decide to force a time where both teams will have the best chances to field as many players as possible.
				</p>
				<p>
					Remember mutual forfeits will count towards a forfeit punishment.
				</p>
				<b>Point Amount:</b> 0
			</div>

		<h3 id="MS-163">2.15.3. Technical</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					Issues resulting in the inability for both teams being able to play the match will result in a technical forfeit. These types of forfeits will not count towards a forfeit punishment. Such instances that could occur and considered a technical forfeit would be widespread power outages, steam outages and server booking issues.
				</p>
				<p>
					Furthermore, technical forfeits are only applicable in cases where both teams are affected by an issue that inhibits them from playing. Failing to show up to a match or organising the match is not a technical forfeit.
				</p>
				<p>
					Upon request by the staff team, teams will be required to provide documentation of the technical difficulty. This will be used to decide disputes or investigations where match fixing could be at play.
				</p>
				<b>Point Amount:</b> 2
			</div>

<h1 id="P-1">3. Punishments</h1>

	<h2 id="P-2">3.1. Forfeits</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				Mutual and loss forfeits add up towards a forfeit punishment. Both types of forfeits equally count as 1 forfeit loss. The main punishment for this type of offense will be the disqualification and removal from the league, therefore the inability to receive a medal. Further punishments for this type of offense will be outlined in the criteria below.
			</p>
		</div>

		<h3 id="P-21">3.1.1. Early Forfeits</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					Early forfeits count as the first two weeks of regular season matches. If a team forfeits these two matches, they will be disqualified and removed from the league.
				</p>
			</div>

		<h3 id="P-22">3.1.2. Total Forfeits</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					Total forfeits count as the entire amount of forfeits a team has taken throughout the season. Upon the third forfeit a team will be disqualified and removed from the league.
				</p>
			</div>

		<h3 id="P-23">3.1.3. Play-Off and Grand Final Forfeits</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					Playoff and Final forfeits count as any match that occurs past the regular season. These types of forfeits will be weighted higher than other forfeit punishments.
				</p>
				<p>
					Forfeits during the play-offs will result in the team being disqualified and removed from the league. If possible the next highest seeded team will replace the team or another team in the play-offs when forfeit instances occur after quarter-finals.
				</p>
				<p>
					Exceptions to the rule can be given depending on the reason of why the team was unable to field the required amount of players. If a team believes they will be unable  to field players during the play-off period, contact the staff team to have your play-off position spot given to another team. Doing this will avoid the punishment and you will still receive participant badges.
				</p>
			</div>

	<h2 id="P-3">3.2. Exploits</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				The intention of exploiting weapons, maps and game engine flaws for an unfair advantage, whether they are listed in the rules or not, is prohibited.
			</p>
			<p>
				Some examples include, but are not limited to
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Exploiting the map design to enter areas which aren’t regular gameplay</li>
				<li>Placing engineer buildings in indestructible areas</li>
				<li>Using scripts/macros that allow you to bypass movement restrictions</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Other scripts that disrupt hitboxes or gameplay</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Changing medic loadouts in spawn to preserve uber percentage</li>
				<li>Removing the black FOV around sniper scope</li>
				<li>Players may not shoot through solid surfaces/doors that are intended to be closed</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				If you are unsure that something is considered an exploit, please contact the staff team and request a ruling to be made.
			</p>
		</div>

	<h2 id="P-4">3.3. Cheating</h2>
		<dir>
			<p>
				Usage of external programs (third-party software), hooks or wrappers is strictly prohibited. This could include but not limited to modified .dll, .exe injecting hook or any software that alters the gameplay that gives the player an unfair advantage.
			</p>
			<p>
				Section 3.7 outlines Account usage regarding ‘Alts’. Competitive players found cheating outside of the leagues on such alt accounts will also be punished to the same extent when cheating within the league.
			</p>
		</dir>

	<h2 id="P-5">3.4. Captaincy</h2>
		<h3 id="P-51">3.4.1. Responsibility</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					Captains shoulder the burden of making sure their players abide by the rules and avoid punishments for rule breaking. Individual players will be punished if the captain is believed to have played a role in the rule breaking or wasn’t aware the rule breaking had occurred.
				</p>
				<p>
					Captains that are found to be aware of a player on their team cheating as an example, will be punished.
				</p>
			</div>

		<h3 id="P-52">3.4.2. Disbanding / Removed</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					Disbanded, removed and disqualified teams all qualify under captaincy punishments. As the person who takes responsibility in the organisation of the team, they are expected to ensure their team is able to make matches or last throughout the season.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some punishments for captains will include captaincy ban for the following season up to a maximum of a permanent captaincy ban.
				</p>
			</div>

	<h2 id="P-6">3.5. Server Usage</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				Abusive administration during official matches from the offending team will lead to an immediate disqualification and removal from the league. In circumstances where the captain was not at fault and a player was, that player will be suspended for the remainder of the season.
			</p>
		</div>

	<h2 id="P-7">3.6. Sportsmanship</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				All players are expected to act in a civilised manner to ensure a non-toxic environment and promote a fun experience. If players are seen to be unable to uphold a good etiquette during a match, those individuals will receive punishments. Furthermore, as per the request from any player or staff member, chat can be completely restricted.
			</p>
			<p>
				Keep in mind there is a fine line between ‘friendly’ banter and poor sportsmanship. It is recommended that you should communicate with the other team only when necessary to prevent anyone getting offended. Prejudicial or egregious treatment of different categories of people, such as but not limited to nationality, sex, age and beliefs during matches or within the community will be punished harshly.
			</p>
			<p>
				On top of the previous, in game play can also be counted as bad sportsmanship. The primary example of this is spawn-camping and not focusing on the objective.

	<h2 id="P-11">3.10. Mercenary Responsibility</h2>
		<div>

				Teams are required to make sure that the opposing team is informed of any accepted mercs that will be in the match. Furthermore, teams must follow section 2.12 and ensure that the match thread is updated with the required information. On top of the previous, keep in mind that each player is limited to merc for such team twice each season.
			</p>
			<p>
				Teams that break this procedure in section 2.12 for a maximum of 2 times will receive a mercenary ban for the remainder of this season. However, in future if the same team consistently neglects this rule, less leniency will be given and harsher punishments will be delivered.
